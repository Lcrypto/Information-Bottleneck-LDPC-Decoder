# Information-Bottleneck-LDPC-Decoder
The GitHub repository contains an Information Bottleneck Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check (QC-LDPC) decoder using the irregular 802.11 code with parameters (1296,648) and rate 1/2.

The decoder is based on information bottleneck theory, which aims to extract the most informative features from noisy data. It uses an iterative decoding algorithm to decode QC-LDPC codes and achieve high performance in the presence of noise.

This particular decoder targets the irregular 802.11 QC-LDPC code with specific parameters, but the implementation can be adapted for other QC-LDPC codes as well.
